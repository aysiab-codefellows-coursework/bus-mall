# Bus-Mall: A Vote Tracking Catalogue
### Created by: Aysia Brown

Bus-Mall is a hypothetical business that wanted to keep track of their popular catalogue items by allowing users to vote for their favorite item. Users are prompted with 25 rounds of voting for catalogue items before being displayed a chart that graphs the numbers of votes a catalogue item had versus the amount of times the item was displayed to the user. The information is stored in localStorage for the user to return to and be able to see later.
